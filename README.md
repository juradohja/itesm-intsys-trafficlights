#### Final Project for the Intelligent Systems course (201913) at ITESM CCM
##### By: Jos√© Alberto Jurado, Kai Kawasaki, Sergio Ugalde

This project is a simulation of an intelligent traffic lights system that varies the time a traffic light is active depending on how much traffic there is. To do this, the project includes a Fuzzy Logic system. Agents in the environment act according to an optimal policy generated by using a Markov Decision Process. This project was developed in C++ making use of OpenGL as well.
